One of the factors to consider when choosing a location of a restaurant is the profile of the neighborhood. A hip fusion cuisine migh not fit well into a neighborhood populated mostly by retirees. A pizza place might struggle in a neighborhood with a high concentration of other pizza places. A coffee shop could do well in a popular tourist spot. \n\nLet's say the restaurant owner is interested in answering these questions:\n - What is the age profile of the residents? \n - What competition exists in the vicinity? \n - Are there other venues people might go to in the vicinity and then opt to grab a bite nearby? \n\nTo try to answer these questions, I'll be working with demographic data of Berlin's residents along with the existing venue data from Forsquare to analyze the neighborhoods and create different neighborhood profiles to assess the locations. I aim to categorize the neighborhoods based on their profile into clusters with similar profiles, to help narrow down the selection of neighborhoods for an owner of a restaurant to choose from."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Data I'll be working with is from the www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de web page. I'm going to be working with the data from this data set, from tab T14: https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/publikationen/stat_berichte/2021/SB_A01-05-00_2020h02_BE.xlsx\n\nThis data set contains data for <b>Berlin</b> from <b>December 31st 2021</b> and includes the following fields:\n- <b>Postleitzahl</b> - postal code\n- <b>Bezirk</b> - borough\n- <b>Insgesamt</b> - total number of residents\n- <b>unter 6</b> - residents under the age of 6\n- <b>6-15</b> - residents between the ages 6 and 15\n- <b>15-18</b> - residents between the ages 15 and 18\n- <b>18-27</b> - residents between the ages 18 and 27\n- <b>27-45</b> - residents between the ages 27 and 45\n- <b>45-55</b> - residents between the ages 45 and 55\n- <b>55-65</b> - residents between the ages 55 and 65\n- <b>65</b> und mehr = residents over the age of 65\n- <b>Darunter Weiblich</b> - number of female residents\n\nThis data set is missing the names of the Neighborhoods (Ortsteil). I found the list of Neighborhoods by postal code here - https://www.dasoertliche.de/Themen/Postleitzahlen/Berlin.html, so I'll try to add this data. \n\nNext there will be the data from Foursquare. I'll query foursquare by postal code to extract the venues in the vicinity of the neighborhoods. From experience I know this data includes the category of venues, that'll help us profile them.\n\nI have considered adding the rent prices for these neighborhoods, however I wasn't able to find something not behind a paywall. Therefore for the purpose of this exercise, we will assume money is no object, or that the restaurant owner will be choosing the neiborhoods by profile first."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Week 2 - not in scope of Week 1 assignment"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Methodology"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Results"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Results section where you discuss the results"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Discussion"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Conclusion"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Conclusion section where you conclude the report."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
